# Back-test-
An internship project: Built a back-testing model containing many critical indexes.

Description of backtest

For each week, we rank all stocks according to their factors and assian them into 5 quantile portfolios. 
Each stock is equally weighted.
For week t, this bactest system can support the L-S strategy, shich means 1 unit in long position in the first quantile, another 1 unit in short position.

There are two editions of this backtest. The first lite one just consider some critical factors, while the second one has also considered the stamp tax and converting positions fee.

Results output:
Annualized Returns
Annualized Volatility

Factor Turnover

I only upload part of my codes in backtesting in considration of privacy.
Please contact me if you want to know more details and we can discuss topics in computational finance.
